# How to run

1. Change the inputs.csv file to add the categories and states which you want to scrape. I've added Accupuncture category and vic state as an example.
2. Click on the Run button.
3. Let it run until you see the log "Reached last page"
4. Open the outputs directory. There you'll find directories for each state.

Note - state-logs directory is only for debugging purposes.
